This is NOT DUOLINGO. If you think it is then no it is not. Run this at your own risk.
Put both files in a folder.
Download both of the files, if you get the batch but not the vbs, it wont work. If you get the vbs then it'll just start with all the warning mumbo jumbo.
Now this game is boring and if you actually play this, thanks.
